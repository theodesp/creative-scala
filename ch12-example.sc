// An algebraic data type is built from two components: - logical ors; and - logical ands.

/*
A PathElement is a sum type, as it is: - a MoveTo; or - a LineTo; or - a CurveTo.

A MoveTo is a product type that holds a single point (where to move to).

A LineTo is a product type that holds a single point (the end point of the line).

A CurveTo is a product type that holds three points: two control points and the end point of the line.
 */

/*
An Instruction is: - a Forward; or - a Turn; or - a Branch; or - a NoOp

Therefore Instruction is a sum type. Forward, Turn, and Branch are all product types.

A Forward holds a distance, which is a Double.

A Turn holds an angle, which is an Angle.

A Branch holds a List[Instruction]â€”therefore the Instruction type is defined in terms of itself, just like List.

A NoOp holds no data.
